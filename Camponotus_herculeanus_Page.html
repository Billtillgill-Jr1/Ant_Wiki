	<h2>Species overview:</h2>
	<p>Camponotus herculeanus or the boreal carpenter ant is a semi-large black and red carpenter ant native to most of the northern hemisphere. They inhabit forests and nest in wood and soil. Camponotus herculeanus does have majors.</p>

	<h2>Nest Behavior:</h2>
	<p>Camponotus herculeanus tends to nest in rotting wood or in loose soil under small rocks. They often have a pile of discarded sawdust outside the nest and will sometimes nest within a few inches of smaller species. Nests can range in size from only a few feet of a fallen log to over 50 feet of a fallen log. Nests in soil tend to be under an area with a bunch of smaller rocks. Often just under the rocks reveals larva of all sizes. Nest queens tend to be closser to the surface then most species and can be seen quite easily.</p>

	<h2>What do they eat:</h2>
	<p>Camponotus herculeanus is known to collect honeydew from aphids or mealybugs often returning to the nest with a full social stomach. They also eat small insects and insect parts.</p>

	<h2>Founding time and behavior:</h2>
	<p>Camponotus herculeanus flies from March to September depending on where you are. Queens mate with one male and then break off there wings. Queens tend to create there claustral chamber in loose soil, under rocks, and in the bark of rotting logs. Queens lay 5-10 eggs for there first generation but often only have 1-4 nanitics since queens will feed a few larva more then the others. If queens fly later in the year often the queen hibernates through winter before her first workers arrive. Development from egg to worker takes around 6-8 weeks, majors and alates can take longer. Colonies can reach over 10000 workers around 5-6 years old and start producing alates around 4-5 years.</p>

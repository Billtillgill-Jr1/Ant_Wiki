	<p>Not all ant pages are fully finished yet only a few are mostly done, this includes: The definitions page, Home page, Species page, Camponotus modoc, Camponotus herculeanus, Pogonomyrmex rugosus, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, Formica podzolica, Pheidole bicarinata, and Tetramorium immigrans. Many of the colors and effects are placeholders and are not final. I am still working on this site and it is nowhere near done yet. If I got anything wrong like some of the information please let me know at: <b>cameronsantwiki001@gmail.com</b><br><br>I will also gladly accept pictures or information to add to the site. You will be credited if you provide anything meaningful to the development. Remember that this is my first big-ish project so be easy on me.

	<h3>The life cycle of ants!</h3>
	<p>There are 4 life stages to an ant. Those being egg, larva, pupa/cocoon, and adult. Each are different in there own way.</p>
	<h3>Eggs:</h3>
	<p>The queen ant lays many eggs a day. When she lays an eggs it will start to develop and hatch into a larva after a few days.</p>
	<h3>Larva:</h3>
	<p>When the egg hatches it becomes a larva. Larva always need food from the workers to grow bigger into the next stage.</p>
	<h3>Pupa:</h3>
	<p>When  a larva has eaten enough it will either spin a cocoon around itself to protect it in its pupa form or it will remain what is called a naked pupa. Naked pupa don't spin cocoons and instead just turn into pupa  with no protection from outside forces.</p>
	<h3>Eclose/adult:</h3>
	<p>As a pupa or cocoon starts to darken over a few days it will eventually start to move around and harden. Over the next few days the ant will darken and harden and then she will be ready to start working. When cocoons are ready to eclose they release a pheromone that lets the workers know that she needs help tearing her cocoon open so she can get out.</p>

	<p>Pogonomyrmex californicus larva stay naked</p>
	<h2>Are they claustral or semi-claustral:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex californicus is semi-claustral and has to collect some seeds to get through the founding period.</p>

	<h2>Nest behavior:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex californicus nests in sandy soil and creates small mounds of soil at the nest entrance. Each nest only has one entrance. Unlike other Pogonomyrmex species Pogonomyrmex californicus does not clear away vegetation from around the nest. The depth of the nest can reach over six feet. There are often seed husks outside the nest.</p>

	<h2>What do they eat:</h2>
  <p>Like most Pogonomyrmex species Pogonomyrmex californicus mainly eats seeds. However they also enjoy insect parts for protein.</p>

	<h2>Founding time and behavior:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex californicus flies from April to August. Queen alates breed with a male and then break off there wings. Pogonomyrmex californicus is polygynous so multiple queens will sometimes found a colony together. Typically smaller queens start a colony together instead of larger ones. Pogonomyrmex californicus is however semi-claustral and has to collect seeds during the founding period to start there colony. Pogonomyrmex californicus queens tend to lay 5-10 eggs in there first batch but do sometimes eat most of them. Development from egg to adult worker take around 4-6 weeks. Queens typically have 2-4 nanitics for there first generation. colonies can reach over 100 workers in there first year and over 2000 after a few years. Alates start to appear around 3-5 years after founding.</p>

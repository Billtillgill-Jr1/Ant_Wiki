	<h3><br>About the site!</h3>
	<p><br>Cameron's Ant Wiki is a project I have been working on to talk about my hobby, Antkeeping!
      Antkeeping is a hobby that not many people know about or seem to understand. Often times I am asked to explain just what is so cool about ants that I turn it into my hobby. Well some of these questions will be answered here on the homepage! </p>

	<h3><br>About me!</h3>
	<p><br>
	  My name is Cameron! I love to play videogames, learn, tinker with electronics, code, and of course antkeeping! I got into this hobby around 6 years ago in 2019 right before we were all stuck at home. I was inspired to start keeping ants after I came across AntsCanada on Youtube! He makes wonderful videos that go into depth on ants and how to start your own antkeeping journey. A big thanks to him and his wonderful videos for getting me hooked on ants! In my time doing this I have learned many valuable lessons about what not to do and what to do. I have lost many young colonies from mistakes I have made along the way, which in turn has helped me get way better at the hobby. Keeping ants is quite a learning experience and requires lots and lots of patience, which I don't have. I have to try my best to have as much as I can and it's hard! Well I'll stop boring you with me and instead lets talk about ants!</p>

	<h3><br>Why are ants cool to me?</h3>
	<p><br>
    Many people don't understand why me and so many other people love ants so much. I just love to watch them attack, carry there food, grow, eat, and have there own personalities! All ant species have a different way of life, whether it be eating habits, nesting behavior, growth speed, or number of queens. My favorite thing about my ants though is watching them trail to a food source I give them! I just love it when I drop some honey or a mealworm into there outworld and they trail to it and hollow out the whole thing, or drag it to there nest. I don't know exactly how to explain why I love ants so much but hopefully you can understand where I'm coming from.</p>

	<h3><br>About the hobby!</h3>
	<p><br>
    Antkeeping is something that requires a lot of patience, walking, looking, and dedication! I will go and spend hours walking around, lifting up rocks, and watching for any movement I see. Most antkeepers go out themselves to go look for queens and always have some sort of container on them in case they find a queen while out and about. I always have test tubes on me, whether it be in my backpack, car, or pocket. When keeping ants you must give them good space to grow but not too much or they could get stressed and die. Expand there space only when they need it. Different species grow at different rates and are different sizes! Some even require special food sources or nest conditions. This will be talked about later in the site!</p>

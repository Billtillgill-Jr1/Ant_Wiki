	<h2>Nest Behavior:</h2>
	<p>Formica podzolica nests in soil and dead pine needles. They create mounds of dead pine needles, dead leaf litter, and soil. This is why they are known as mound ants or thatching ants. Often times the mound can be a few feet long and a few inches tall. There nests are pretty easy to spot because of this. </p>

	<h2>Founding time and behavior:</h2>
  <p>Formica podzolica flies in June, July, and August. Queens mate with one male before breaking off there wings and looking for a place to dig her claustral chamber. Queens ofter nest under rocks in chambers a few inches deep. Depending on what month they fly changes when there first workers arrive. If they fly in June or July workers can arrive before the first snow. If they fly in August or September queens may not even lay eggs till spring of next year. Queens typically lay a few eggs to start and don't lay anymore till workers arrive. The first workers arrive on average 6-7 weeks after eggs are laid. Colonies can reach 4000+ workers after 4-5 years. Alates start to appear around 4-5 years.</p>

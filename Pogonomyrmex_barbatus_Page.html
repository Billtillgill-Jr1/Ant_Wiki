	<h2>Species overview:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus or the Red Harvester Ant, is a large species of harvester ant native to Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and parts of Northern Mexico. They collect seeds as a food source and create small flat rock mounds outside there nest entrance.</p>

	<h2>Good to know:</h2>	
	<h3>Here is some good to know info about the species!</h3>	
	<h2>Scientific name and common name:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus-Red Harvester Ant</p>
	<h2>Native or invasive to Utah:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus is native</p>
	<h2>Are they Polygynous:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus is not</p>
	<h2>Do the larva spin cocoons or stay naked:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus larva stay naked</p>
	<h2>Are they claustral or semi-claustral:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus is more of a semi-claustral species since after the queen digs her claustral chamber she will go get a few insect parts and seeds, but not always.</p>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="writing">
	<h2>Nest Behavior:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus often nests in sandy soil. They clear all vegetation within a few feet of there nest entrance. They have piles of discarded seed husks a few inches away from the entrance, and also create long flat rock piles around the nest.</p>
	
	
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="writing">
	<h2>What do they eat:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus eats mainly seeds, but will always take insect parts. They have large foraging trails with hundreds of workers looking for seeds to bring back to the nest. They crush the seeds into an "ant bread" which the queen, workers, and there larva eat.</p>

	<div class="writing">
	<h2>Founding time and behavior:</h2>
	<p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus flies from April to September after thunderstorms. After queens have mated they break off there wings and look for a place to dig her claustral chamber. When queens are finished with digging they usually gather a few seeds and insect parts to eat and feed to her larva. Worker development takes on average 4-8 weeks from egg to worker. Queens use there muscle tissue and the seeds they gathered for there first generation. After the workers must find food. Pogonomyrmex barbatus does not have majors, but some Pogonomyrmex species do. In the wild colonies can reach populations in the upper 10000's after a few years. Alate production starts around 4-6 years old. Workers and the queen can be a reddish-orange or a bright red. Pogonomyrmex barbatus has quite painful stings so be carful when keeping them.</p>

  <h2>Some other things to know:</h2>
  <p>Pogonomyrmex barbatus has a special way of breeding. Pogonomyrmex barbatus has to breed with a male of there own species to be able to produce alates, but also have to breed with a male from Pogonomyrmex rugosus to be able to create worker ants.</p>
